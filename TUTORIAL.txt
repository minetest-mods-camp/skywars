(If you find it uncomfortable to read the tutorial from the chat
you can read it from a file in the mod folder called TUTORIAL.txt)

These are the steps to follow in order to create and configure an 
arena:


1) Creating the arena using:

/skywars create <arena name> [min players] [max players]
where min players is equal to the minimun amount of players to make 
the arena start, and max players to the maximum amount of players that
an arena can have.


2) Editing the arena using:

/skywars edit <arena name>
in this menu you can add spawn points and set up the sign to enter the
arena: the spawn points are where the players will spawn when they 
enter the arena, while the sign is just the way to enter it (by 
clicking it).


3) Setting the arena treasures (the items that can spawn in the 
chests):
item: the item name
rarity: how often it will spawn in chests
preciousness: in which chests it can be put, for example a chest with 
a preciousness range 2-4 can spawn just items with a preciousness 
between 2 and 4
count: the item amount

/skywars addtreasure <arena name> <item> <count> <rarity (min 1.0, max 
10.0)> <preciousness>

You can also use: 
/skywars addtreasure hand <arena name> <rarity (min 1.0, max 10.0)> 
<preciousness>
this will get the item name and count from the one in your hand.


4) Setting the chests in the arena using:

/skywars addchest <arena name> <min_preciousness> <max_preciousness> 
<min_treasures_amount (min. 1)> <max_treasures_amount>
to add a chest that will be filled with the right treasures when the match
starts, this will set the position to the node you're looking at (not over it).

You can also use: 

/skywars addchest pos <arena name> <min_preciousness> <max_preciousness> 
<min_treasures_amount (min. 1)> <max_treasures_amount>
this will set the position over the node you're standing on.


5) Saving the map area using:

/skywars pos1 <arena name>
/skywars pos2 <arena name>
in order to kill players that go out of the map, you have to define a 
map area; to do so, simply specify its corners by using
/skywars pos1 and /skywars pos2.

! WARNING !
To modify a map you must use use /skywars reset <arena name> and then disable 
the arena, otherwise your changes may get lost.
Everything you change when the arena's disabled won't be saved, so make
sure to properly reset your map before doing so (e.g. if when you reset the arena
flowing lava and water created some stone it won't be resetted the first time, so
you'll have to reset it until the map is clear).


6) (Optional) Creating and setting the kits using: 

/skywars createkit <kit name> <texture name>: texture name is the texture
that the kit button will have in the selector menu at the start of the match,
it must be a file name that you put in the <SKYWARS MOD FOLDER>/textures folder.

/skywars additem <kit name> <item> <count>: with this you can add items to it
or
/skywars additem hand <kit name>

/skywars arenakit add <arena name> <kit name>: each arena has a "kits" property
that contains the choosable kits, with this command you add one to it.


7) Enabling the arena using

/skywars enable <arena name>



Once you've done this you can click the sign and start playing :).
You can use /help skywars to read all the commands.
To modify the game settings (such as the messages prefix or the
hub spawn point) you can edit the SETTINGS.lua file.
