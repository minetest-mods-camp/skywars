These are the steps to follow in order to create and configure an 
arena:


1) Creating the arena using:

/skywars create <arena name> [min players] [max players]
where min players is equal to the minimun amount of players to make 
the arena start, and max players to the maximum amount of players that
an arena can have.


2) Editing the arena using:

/skywars edit <arena name>
in this menu you can add spawn points and set up the sign to enter the
arena: the spawn points are where the players will spawn when they 
enter the arena, while the sign is just the way to enter it (by 
clicking it).


3) Setting the arena treasures (the items that can spawn in the 
chests):
item: the item name
rarity: how often it will spawn in chests (the rarity gap between two 
treasures should be at least of 2)
preciousness: in which chests it can be put, for example a chest with 
a preciousness range 2-4 can spawn just items with a preciousness 
between 2 and 4
count: the item amount

/skywars addtreasure <arena name> <item> <rarity (min 2.0, max 
1000.0)> <preciousness> <count>


4) Setting the chests in the arena using:

/skywars addchest <arena name> <min_preciousness> <max_preciousness> 
<min_treasures_amount (min. 1)> <max_treasures_amount>
to add a chest use this command at the position you want it to spawn, it 
will automatically be filled with the right items when the match 
starts


5) Saving the map schematic using:

/skywars pos1
/skywars pos2
/skywars createschematic <arena name> <schematic_name>
in order to automatically reset the map on every match, you have to 
create a schematic file; to do so, simply specify the corners of the 
map by facing NORTH (you can press F5 to know where you're facing), 
and by being sure pos1 Z is SMALLER than pos2 Z (/skywars pos1 and 
/skywars pos2 to set the two corners).
!If you overwrite a schematic that you've already created before make 
sure to reload the server, so that it can be loaded correctly, and 
remember that the old schematic won't be deleted!


6) Enabling the arena using

/skywars enable <arena name>
wars to read all the commands
To modify the game settings

Once you've done this you can click the sign and start playing :)
You can use /help sky (such as the messages prefix or the
hub spawn point) you can edit the SETTINGS.lua file
